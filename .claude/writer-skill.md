# Writer Skill: Style Guide

> Voice: "Plainspoken, Highly Literate, Slightly Dangerous"

---

## 1. The North Star

Your posts have two jobs that usually fight each other:

1. **Deliver real thought** — original framing, clean reasoning, interesting specifics
2. **Move the reader** — attention, trust, "this person thinks clearly," and "I want to work with them"

Treat this as "literary clarity under business constraints."

### Non-Negotiables

- **Clarity beats cleverness.** You can be stylish only after you're precise.
- **Specificity beats abstraction.** Replace "stakeholders" with "a CFO who is sick of surprises in pipeline."
- **Compression beats completeness.** Keep the narrative line taut; push footnotes/appendices elsewhere.

---

## 2. Voice

**Target:** Conversational authority — calm, non-performative intelligence.

### What to Sound Like

- A person who can explain hard things simply without condescension
- Someone who has read widely, but doesn't cite it to posture
- A consultant who can also write

### What to Avoid (AI Tells)

- Symmetrical phrasing for its own sake ("not only…but also…" repeatedly)
- Over-hedging ("it seems," "may," "might" in every paragraph)
- Generic transitions ("furthermore," "moreover," "in conclusion")
- Overly even tone with no human emphasis, no sharp edges, no humor

## 3. The Core Move: Start With a Claim, Not a Topic

**Bad:** "This post is about GTM analytics."

**Good:** "Most GTM dashboards are elaborate ways to avoid answering one question: what would we do differently if this number moved?"

Every post needs a **spine sentence:**

- A claim that can be disagreed with
- A tension the reader feels in their bones
- A promise of resolution

### Template

> "Everyone thinks X. The real problem is Y. Here's the clean way to see it."

---

## 4. The Hook: First 120 Words

Your opening must do at least two of these:

- Pose a sharp question
- Offer a contrarian claim
- Use a concrete micro-story
- Name the stakes ("why you should care")
- Create a clean mental model ("here's the frame")

### High-Performing Hook Patterns

**The uncomfortable truth:**
> "Most 'AI strategy' decks are theater: they launder uncertainty into certainty-shaped bullets."

**The tiny scene:**
> A meeting moment, a spreadsheet, a Slack thread, a customer call.

**The reframing line:**
> "This isn't a tooling problem. It's a decision hygiene problem."

## 5. Structure: Scannable Without Feeling Shallow

Use essay structure with product readability.

### Recommended Layout

1. Title (tight, specific, slightly provocative)
2. 2–3 line lede (hook + spine)
3. "What this post will do" (one short paragraph)
4. Sections with informative headings
5. Occasional callouts (1–2 sentences)
6. A close that lands the thesis and implies action

### Scannability Rules

- Headings every 150–250 words
- Paragraphs 1–4 lines. If longer, it must earn it.
- Lists only when they clarify decisions, steps, or contrasts

### Headings Should Carry Meaning

**Bad:** "Background"

**Good:** "Why your CRM tells the truth too late"

---

## 6. Sentence Craft: The "Clean Blade" Standard

### Default Sentence Style

- Short-to-medium sentences
- One main idea per sentence
- Use long sentences sparingly, for rhythm and emphasis

### Rhythm Technique

Mix: short / medium / short.

Use an occasional long sentence as a "spotlight" paragraph, then snap back.

### Rules

- Prefer strong verbs over adjective stacks
- Prefer concrete nouns over abstractions
- Use parentheses rarely; they read like side quests
- Kill throat-clearing: "It's important to note that…"

### Before/After

**Before:** "There are a number of considerations that organizations should think about…"

**After:** "Two things matter: incentives and feedback loops."

## 7. The Signature Move: Analogies That Earn Their Keep

You want the Bryson/Sapolsky effect: accessible, vivid, memorable. But in business writing, analogies must be precise, not cute.

### Analogy Rules

- It must map cleanly to the real system
- It must not oversimplify the causality
- Keep it short (1–4 sentences)
- Return quickly to the business point

### Example

> "Forecasts fail the way diets fail: not because people don't know what 'healthy' means, but because the environment rewards the opposite behavior."

---

## 8. Intellectual Integrity: Show Your Work

Top writers earn trust by being explicit about what's known, assumed, and uncertain.

### Use Epistemic Labels Lightly

- "Here's what I'm confident about…"
- "Here's the part people argue about…"
- "Here's my bet…"

### Evidence Pattern

Claim → mechanism → example → implication.

If you cite numbers, cite them cleanly (and link sources on-site).

## 9. The Consultant Layer: Translate Insight Into Decisions

Your content is a portfolio. Each piece should subtly answer:

- What do you notice that others miss?
- How do you think?
- What would change if someone hired you?

### Decision Translation Prompts

- "So what do we do Monday morning?"
- "What would I measure instead?"
- "What tradeoff are we actually choosing?"

### Practical Takeaways Block

Add near the end:
- 3–7 bullets
- Each bullet is an action or diagnostic question
- No platitudes

---

## 10. Human Markers (Anti-AI Authenticity)

Use sparingly; the goal is authenticity, not quirks.

### Human Markers That Work

- **Controlled opinion:** "This is why I dislike most AI roadmaps."
- **Selective humor:** One wry line, then back to work.
- **Honest limits:** "I can't prove this across every company, but I've seen the pattern enough to trust it."

### Human Markers to Avoid

- Over-snark
- Self-indulgent digressions
- Excessive rhetorical questions

---

## 11. Title and Subtitle System

### Title Traits

- Specific, not broad
- Signals a tension, not a category
- Implies a point of view

### Good Patterns

- "The KPI That Quietly Ruins Your Forecast"
- "AI Strategy Is Mostly Incentive Design"
- "Your CRM Doesn't Need More Fields. It Needs Fewer Lies."

### Subtitles

Add the promise: "A practical way to make decisions with imperfect data."

## 12. Editing Checklist: The Five Passes

1. **Spine pass:** Can I state the thesis in one sentence? Is every section serving it?
2. **Clarity pass:** Remove jargon; replace with concrete examples.
3. **Compression pass:** Cut 15–30% of words. Tighten intros and transitions.
4. **Voice pass:** Add 2–3 "you can't fake this" sentences (opinion, observation, story).
5. **Scan pass:** Headings, paragraph length, lists, bold only for true anchors.

---

## 13. Reusable Templates

### A) The Op-Ed Consultant Post

1. Hook with tension
2. Thesis (spine sentence)
3. Why the common view fails
4. The real mechanism
5. A concrete case (story, vignette, or mini example)
6. The model (simple framework)
7. Practical takeaways
8. Close with a sharp line + implied invitation

### B) The Field Guide Post

> "If you're seeing X, it's usually because Y."

5 patterns, each with:
- Symptom
- Cause
- Fast test
- Fix
- Common mistake

### C) The "One Hard Idea Made Simple"

1. One concept (e.g., "evaluation loops")
2. Explain in 2 metaphors + 1 concrete workflow
3. Provide a checklist + minimal example artifacts

### D) The Project Case Study

Project writeups follow the same header rules as articles: meaning-carrying, not positional.

**Structure:**
1. Problem/Stakes hook (no header—just open with the situation)
2. Core insight/approach headers that preview the key decision or finding
3. Implementation headers that name what was built/changed
4. Outcome header that previews the result
5. Lesson header that states the counterintuitive learning

**Bad headers:** Context, Approach, Results, Insight

**Good headers:**
- "47 Minutes Instead of 8 Hours"
- "Three Tiers of Autonomy"
- "The Qualification Bottleneck"
- "What 'Qualified' Actually Means"

The reader should be able to reconstruct the case study from headers alone.

---

## 14. Site-Specific Conventions

### End Every Post With

"If you're dealing with this, here's how I help:" (2–4 bullets)

A single CTA (calendar, email, or "read related post")

### Use "Proof of Thought" Blocks

- "What I'd do in 30 days"
- "What I'd measure weekly"
- "What I'd stop doing immediately"

### Interlink Aggressively

- Each post links to 2–4 others
- Build a "mental model library," not a chronological blog

---

## 15. Micro-Style Rules (Quick Reference)

- Prefer active voice, but don't fetishize it
- Prefer named actors: "Sales Ops" "AE" "CFO" "Support lead"
- Use numbers only when meaningful: "three failure modes," "two constraints"
- Don't bold for decoration; bold only for navigation anchors
- Avoid business filler: "leverage," "synergy," "paradigm," "stakeholders" (unless necessary)
- Don't end with "In conclusion." End with a line that lands.

## Summary Table

| Component | Goal | Practical Rule | Common Failure Mode | Fix |
|-----------|------|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Thesis (spine) | Create a coherent argument | One sentence you can disagree with | "Topic" instead of "claim" | State the contrarian/tension explicitly |
| Hook | Earn attention fast | Do 2 of: question, contrarian claim, micro-story, stakes, model | Generic scene-setting | Start with a sharp observation + stakes |
| Structure | Scannable but substantive | Headings every 150–250 words; short paragraphs | Wall-of-text essay | Break with meaning-carrying headings |
| Style | Clear, human, literate | Strong verbs, concrete nouns, minimal hedging | AI-flat neutrality | Add controlled opinion + specificity |
| Analogies | Make complex ideas stick | 1–4 sentences, precise mapping | Cute but misleading metaphor | Tie back immediately to mechanism |
| Evidence | Build trust | Claim → mechanism → example → implication | Assertions without grounding | Add one real vignette or testable check |
| Consultant translation | Convert insight into value | "What to do Monday" takeaways | Interesting but non-actionable | Add diagnostics + decisions |
| Editing | Tighten and de-AI the draft | 5-pass process; cut 15–30% | Overlong intros + filler transitions | Cut throat-clearing and redundant setup |
| Website CTA | Turn reading into contact | 2–4 "how I help" bullets + one CTA | Salesy pitch | Keep it specific and low-pressure |
