title: "Obsidian"
description: "The note-taking tool for people who think in connections, not folders."
category: "productivity"
verdict: "Plain text files, bidirectional links, and local-first storage. What notes should have been all along."
use_when: "You're building a knowledge system, not just taking meeting notes. You want to own your data. You think in connections."
skip_when: "You need real-time collaboration, prefer cloud-first tools, or your note-taking is purely transactional."

Most note-taking apps are document storage with search. Obsidian is different: it treats your notes as a graph of connected ideas. Bidirectional links mean every connection works both ways. The graph view shows you patterns you didn't know existed. And everything is plain Markdown files on your local filesystem.

That last part matters more than it seems. Your notes aren't locked in someone's proprietary format or held hostage by a subscription. They're text files. They'll open in any editor, sync with any tool, survive any company going bankrupt.

## What I use it for

- **Project knowledge bases**: Everything I learn about a domain, linked and searchable
- **Writing drafts**: Long-form pieces start as connected notes, then get assembled
- **Daily notes**: Quick capture with automatic links to relevant projects
- **Technical documentation**: Personal reference docs for tools and workflows I use repeatedly

## What I wish it did better

Collaboration is the obvious gap. Obsidian is fundamentally a single-player tool. The sync service works, but real-time collaboration isn't the model. If you need Google Docs-style sharing, look elsewhere.

And the plugin ecosystem is both a strength and a weakness. There's a plugin for everything, but quality varies wildly. I've settled on a minimal set of trusted plugins and resist the urge to over-customize.

For solo knowledge work, though, nothing else matches it. The combination of simplicity, power, and data ownership is rare.
