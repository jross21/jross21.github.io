A growth-stage SaaS team had strong top-of-funnel motion but weak forecasting credibility. Pipeline stages meant different things to different teams. Coverage targets were inconsistent. Forecast calls were reactive and opinion-driven.

The goal was to create a forecast system leaders could trust, without adding complexity to reps' workflows.

## What Changed

**Standardized stage definitions.** Clear exit criteria by stage and segment, with required fields and validation rules.

**Coverage targets by segment.** Set 3.0x+ coverage based on conversion data and cycle length, with variance bands by region.

**Operating cadence.** Weekly forecast reviews with variance tracking, monthly pipeline health checks, quarterly capacity planning.

**Single source of truth.** Dashboarded the forecast in one place with consistent definitions across RevOps, Sales, and Finance.

## Outcomes

- Forecast accuracy improved from ~62% to ~84% within tolerance.
- Stage aging dropped ~35% in the most stalled stages.
- Executive reporting latency went from ~5 days to under 24 hours.
- Coverage variance reduced by ~30% and stabilized around 3.2x.

## Why It Worked

Forecast accuracy is a systems problem, not a modeling problem. The win came from shared definitions, a consistent review rhythm, and a governance layer that made the data dependable without slowing the field.
