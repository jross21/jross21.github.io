  outcome: "Cut operational overhead 40% by reducing 11 revenue tools to 4."
  context: "A Series B company had a fragmented stack and hidden automations."
  change: "Audited the stack, consolidated core systems, and retired redundant tools."
---

A Series B company had grown from $2M to $18M ARR in three years. Their revenue stack had grown too—organically, reactively, and expensively. Eleven different tools across sales, marketing, and customer success. Multiple sources of truth. Data that never quite matched between systems.

The RevOps team spent more time maintaining integrations than improving processes. Every new initiative required navigating a maze of dependencies. The CFO was asking hard questions about software spend that had tripled while headcount doubled.

The goal wasn't "fewer tools." It was a system that could scale without requiring heroics to operate.

## 47 Automations, 12 Nobody Knew Existed

Documented every tool, integration, and data flow. Not how things were supposed to work—how they actually worked. Discovered 47 automations, including 12 that nobody knew existed and 3 that directly contradicted each other.

Categorized each component:

**Core (essential, keep):** CRM, marketing automation, data warehouse

**Redundant (overlapping, consolidate):** Three different email tools, two meeting schedulers

**Legacy (no longer needed, deprecate):** Tools from old processes nobody ran anymore

**Custom (evaluate):** Homegrown integrations that might have vendor alternatives

## 80% Feature Parity for 100% Integration

Designed the target state: 4 core platforms instead of 11, native integrations instead of Zapier chains, single source of truth for customer data.

Key principle: accept 80% feature parity for 100% integration simplicity. The "best" individual tool that doesn't integrate cleanly isn't the best system.

## Migration Without the Big Bang

Sequenced carefully to avoid breaking active campaigns and deals:

- Week 1-2: Deprecated tools with no dependencies
- Week 3-4: Consolidated overlapping functionality
- Week 5-6: Migrated data and retired legacy systems

Built parallel systems during transition. Old tools stayed live until new workflows were validated. No "big bang" cutover.

Every remaining integration has an owner, documentation, and monitoring. New tools require business case review and integration plan before approval.

## From 11 Tools to 4

**After 90 days:**

- Revenue tools: 11 → 4
- Monthly software spend: 40% reduction
- RevOps time on maintenance: 35% → 12%
- Time to implement new workflows: 3 weeks → 4 days
- Data sync errors: 23/month → 2/month

The harder-to-measure win: the team could finally say "yes" to new initiatives instead of "let me check what might break."

## Every Tool Has a Champion

Tech stack consolidation isn't about spending less on tools. It's about spending time on the right things. The maintenance burden of a complex stack is invisible until you remove it—then you realize how much capacity was trapped in keeping things running.

The mistake companies make: optimizing for individual tool capabilities instead of system-level outcomes. The "best" email tool that requires three integrations to work with your CRM isn't the best choice. Sometimes good enough and well-integrated beats great and isolated.

The hardest part is political, not technical. Every tool has a champion. Every integration was someone's solution. Getting to "yes" on consolidation requires executive cover and clear criteria for what stays and what goes.
