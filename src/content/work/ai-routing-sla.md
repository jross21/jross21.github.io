Inbound volume grew faster than SDR capacity. Response times stretched to hours, and routing rules were brittle. The business wanted speed without risking lead quality or brand trust.

The goal was to introduce AI safely, with clear guardrails and measurable impact.

## What Changed

**Tiered routing.** Auto, assisted, and human-required tiers based on ICP fit and intent signals.

**Enrichment + scoring.** Standardized enrichment sources and scoring logic with continuous validation.

**SLA enforcement.** Timers, alerts, and escalation rules for any lead that violated response targets.

**Human checkpoints.** QA queues for edge cases and monthly threshold tuning to reduce false positives.

## Outcomes

- First response time improved from ~8 hours to ~45 minutes.
- MQL-to-SQL conversion increased by ~25%.
- 40% of inbound volume auto-routed with false positives around 4%.
- SDR research time reduced by ~50%, expanding capacity ~25%.

## Why It Worked

The AI did the repetitive work, while humans owned the edge cases. Clear tiers and feedback loops kept automation accurate and trustworthy.
