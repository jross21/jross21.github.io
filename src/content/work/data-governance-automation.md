A multi-system RevOps stack was producing conflicting metrics across CRM, marketing automation, and BI. Teams spent hours each week reconciling reports and fixing duplicate records.

The goal was to establish a dependable data foundation that could support analytics, automation, and AI initiatives.

## What Changed

**Canonical data model.** Defined source-of-truth ownership for accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities.

**Automated validation.** Required-field checks, format validation, and routing rules enforced at creation and update.

**Deduplication + enrichment.** Scheduled matching and merge workflows with controlled enrichment sources.

**Governance ownership.** Data stewards for each domain with weekly quality scorecards.

## Outcomes

- Required-field completeness increased from ~64% to ~92%.
- Duplicate contact rate dropped by ~78%.
- Data-related tickets fell ~60% and reporting rework declined ~45%.
- New lead source onboarding decreased from ~2 weeks to ~4 days.

## Why It Worked

The improvements held because governance was built into daily workflows. Fixing data quality once is easy. Keeping it clean requires rules, ownership, and visibility.
