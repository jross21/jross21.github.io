The RevOps automation conversation usually starts wrong. Someone sees a demo. The demo looks impressive. Six months later, the team has built something nobody uses because it solved the wrong problem.

The best automation roadmaps don't start with technology. They start with watching where your team actually spends time.

## Why Vendor Demos Are the Wrong Starting Point

Vendors optimize demos for "wow," not for your specific bottlenecks. They show you what their tool does well—not what your team needs most.

The result: teams automate tasks that sound important but aren't actually eating hours. Meanwhile, the real time sinks continue unaddressed.

I've seen teams spend six months building AI-powered forecasting while their ops person still manually reconciles lead data for three hours every Monday.

## The Two-Week Time Audit

Before any technology discussion, run this exercise:

**Week one:** Have every RevOps team member log their tasks with three tags. Task name. Time spent. Category (data cleanup, reporting, routing, communication, other).

**Week two:** Same thing. You need two weeks to catch the irregular stuff—the monthly reconciliation, the quarterly audit prep, the "this only happens when someone complains" tasks.

Don't overthink the tracking. A shared spreadsheet works. The goal isn't perfect data—it's pattern recognition.

## The Frequency × Revenue Matrix

Now you have a list of tasks. Plot them on a 2×2:

**X-axis: Frequency.** How often does this happen? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?

**Y-axis: Revenue Impact.** If this task went wrong, what's the blast radius? Does it affect pipeline visibility? Customer experience? Deal velocity?

The quadrants tell you where to focus:

**High frequency, high impact:** Automate first. These tasks eat hours and matter.

**High frequency, low impact:** Automate for efficiency, but don't over-invest.

**Low frequency, high impact:** Keep humans involved. The stakes are too high for "set and forget."

**Low frequency, low impact:** Ignore. Don't automate things that barely happen and barely matter.

## The Hidden Third Axis: Exception Rate

Some tasks look perfect for automation until you watch someone actually do them.

"Update deal stages" sounds like a rules-based task. Until you realize the rep spends half the time interpreting vague customer signals, guessing timelines, and making judgment calls about whether "we'll revisit next quarter" means dead or dormant.

Exception rate measures how often a task requires human judgment. High-exception tasks are automation graveyards.

Before automating anything in your upper-right quadrant, ask: How often does this task require interpretation, context, or a judgment call?

If the answer is "most of the time," that's a human-in-the-loop task, not a full automation candidate.

## Building the Automation Backlog

Your matrix gives you a prioritized list. Convert it to a backlog:

**Task:** What gets automated?

**Current state:** How is this done today? How long does it take?

**Desired state:** What would "automated" look like? Full automation? AI-assisted? Approval workflow?

**Dependencies:** What data, systems, or permissions does this require?

**Estimated value:** Hours saved per week × impact weight.

Resist the urge to tackle everything. Pick two or three tasks from the upper-right quadrant. Build. Measure. Then expand.

## The Test

If you can't describe where your RevOps team actually spends their time—with numbers, not guesses—you're not ready to automate anything.

Run the audit first. Build the matrix. The roadmap writes itself.
