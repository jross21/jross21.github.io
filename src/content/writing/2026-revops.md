The December planning ritual is organizational theater. Executives retreat into spreadsheets. Assumptions get encoded as certainty. By March, reality has diverged—but the plan stays fixed, because changing it would mean admitting the exercise was performance.

## The Fiction of 12-Month Forecasts

Annual planning assumes predictability that no longer exists. Economic shifts happen faster. Competitive disruption is continuous. The macro forecast underpinning your December plan changed completely by February.

But nobody revisits it. So teams execute the wrong plan well instead of the right plan imperfectly.

## The Sunk Cost Trap

Once you've invested weeks building a plan, organizations become committed. You allocated marketing budget in December. The channel mix is wrong by March. But changing the plan requires meetings, explanations, political cost. So the wrong plan continues.

## Rolling Quarters

Leading revenue orgs have shifted to rolling quarterly planning. Each quarter, they reassess and extend the horizon—adjusting forecasts, budgets, and tactics based on what they've learned.

**Monthly:** Pipeline inspection, conversion rates, rep performance. Not reporting—decision-making. What changes this month?

**Quarterly:** Strategic reset. Are assumptions still valid? Do we reallocate? A rolling 4-quarter forecast gives 12-month visibility, but you update it quarterly based on results.

## The Cost Nobody Mentions

Rolling planning requires faster data. If you wait until month-end to see performance, you can't react quarterly.

It requires comfort with ambiguity. Annual planning feels safe because it creates certainty. Rolling planning means accepting you don't know Q3 until you see Q2.

And it requires leadership that rewards "being right" over "sticking to the plan."

## The Real Question

The question isn't whether your plan will be wrong. It will. The question is whether you'll notice—and whether your organization lets you do anything about it.
