Vendors now call Zapier integrations "agentic." SDR email sequencers. Lead scoring models that haven't been updated since 2022.

When every feature is agentic, the word means nothing—which is a problem, because the real thing is coming.

## The Confusion

The agentic hype creates two opposite failures. **Over-trust:** teams deploy AI expecting full autonomy, then face chaos when the system confidently makes bad decisions. **Under-deployment:** scared by the hype, teams keep humans in every loop—even when automation would be safe.

Both stem from the same gap: no mental model for thinking about autonomy levels.

## The Autonomy Ladder

Each level answers one question: who decides, and who acts?

**Level 0: Rules Without Intelligence.** Not AI. Traditional if/then logic. Lead fills out form, gets assigned to rep. Deal hits Stage 3, notification fires. If your vendor calls this "intelligent automation," that's a red flag.

**Level 1: AI Assists, You Decide.** Human triggers the action, AI executes. AI-drafted emails that humans review. Recommended actions that humans choose. Call summaries that humans verify.

**Level 2: AI Proposes, You Approve.** AI identifies opportunities and proposes actions. Humans approve or reject. AI flags at-risk deals and suggests interventions. AI notices pipeline gaps and recommends adjustments.

**Level 3: AI Acts, You Supervise.** AI acts within defined guardrails. Humans oversee. AI SDRs that research, generate outreach, respond to queries, schedule meetings—within approved parameters. AI that adjusts scoring weights based on conversion data.

**Level 4: AI Owns It.** AI operates independently. In RevOps, this is rare—usually limited to low-stakes, high-volume operations. Automated data enrichment. Real-time lead scoring. Dynamic content personalization.

## What Goes Where

**Push toward higher autonomy:** Data operations. High-volume, low-stakes outreach. Routine analysis. Internal routing. Limited blast radius, minimal value from human oversight.

**Keep humans in the loop:** Strategic account decisions. High-value customer communications. Forecasting that affects headcount. Anything difficult to reverse.

## The Point

"Agentic" isn't binary. The teams that win with AI match the right autonomy level to each function—pushing automation where it's safe, preserving human judgment where it matters.

That requires a framework, not a buzzword.
