Last week I saw a vendor call their Zapier integration "agentic." The week before, an SDR email sequencer. Three months ago, a lead scoring model that hasn't been updated since 2022.

When every feature is agentic, the word means nothing—which is a problem, because the real thing is coming.

## When "Agentic" Means Nothing

The agentic confusion creates two opposite failures. **Over-trust:** teams deploy AI expecting full autonomy, then face chaos when the system confidently makes bad decisions. AI SDRs that embarrass your brand. Forecasting models that predict wrong at scale. **Under-deployment:** scared by the hype, teams keep humans in every loop—even when automation would be safe.

Both stem from the same gap: no mental model for thinking about autonomy levels.

## The Autonomy Ladder: Five Levels, One Decision

I've seen this ladder work across 15 implementations. It's not universal law—it's a thinking tool. Each level answers one question: who decides, and who acts?

## Level 0: Rules Without Intelligence

Not AI at all. Traditional if/then logic. When a lead fills out a form, assign it to a rep. When a deal hits Stage 3, send a notification.

Level 0 isn't AI. If your vendor calls if/then logic "intelligent automation," you have my permission to leave the meeting.

*Examples:* Lead routing, SLA alerts, workflow triggers
*Human role:* Design the rules, monitor for exceptions

## Level 1: AI Assists, You Decide

Human triggers the action, AI executes. You decide *what* happens, AI handles *how*.

*Examples:* AI-drafted emails that humans review before sending. Recommended next-best-actions that humans choose to take. Call summaries that humans verify.
*Human role:* Initiate, review, approve

## Level 2: AI Proposes, You Approve

AI identifies opportunities and proposes actions. Humans approve or reject. The AI is proactive; humans remain the decision-makers.

*Examples:* AI flags at-risk deals and suggests interventions. AI identifies upsell opportunities and drafts outreach. AI notices pipeline gaps and recommends territory adjustments.
*Human role:* Evaluate proposals, approve or modify

## Level 3: AI Acts, You Supervise

AI acts within defined guardrails. Humans oversee. The AI makes decisions and executes, but operates within constraints and reports back.

*Examples:* AI SDRs that research accounts, generate personalized outreach, respond to queries, schedule meetings—all within approved messaging and targeting parameters. AI that adjusts lead scoring weights based on conversion data.
*Human role:* Set guardrails, monitor outcomes, handle exceptions

## Level 4: AI Owns It

AI operates independently. In RevOps, this is rare—usually limited to low-stakes, high-volume operations.

Level 4 autonomy in RevOps makes me nervous. Not because AI can't handle it—because most teams can't handle the loss of control. They say they want autonomous systems, then panic when they can't see every decision.

*Examples:* Automated data enrichment. Real-time lead scoring. Dynamic content personalization.
*Human role:* System design, periodic audits

## What Gets Pushed Up, What Stays Down

The framework's value is matching each function to the right level.

**Push toward higher autonomy:** Data operations. High-volume, low-stakes outreach. Routine analysis. Internal routing. These are high-volume, rule-based decisions where AI errors have limited blast radius and human oversight adds little value.

**Keep humans in the loop:** Strategic account decisions. Customer-facing communications to high-value accounts. Forecasting that affects headcount. Anything difficult to reverse. These require judgment, relationship context, or have significant consequences if wrong.

**The sequence:** Map your workflows to levels. Find where you're over-investing human time on Level 1-2 tasks that could be Level 3-4. Find where you've pushed to Level 3-4 without proper guardrails. Build monitoring infrastructure before increasing autonomy. Move up gradually.

## The Right Level, Not the Highest Level

"Agentic" isn't binary. The RevOps teams that win with AI won't deploy the most autonomous systems. They'll match the right autonomy level to each function—pushing automation where it's safe, preserving human judgment where it matters.

That requires a framework, not a buzzword.
