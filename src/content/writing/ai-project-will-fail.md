title: "Why Your Ambitious RevOps AI Initiative Won't Deliver"

Most RevOps AI projects optimize for impressive demos instead of durable architecture. Teams bolt AI onto fragmented systems, then watch it degrade as models evolve and the underlying mess reasserts itself.

The 10% that succeed design for two primary goals: a data layer that serves everything downstream, and an experience that fits how people already work.

## The Data Layer Is the Foundation

Your data has two audiences now: humans and machines. Humans are forgiving readers—they fill gaps, interpret context, know that "TBD" in the close date field means the rep hasn't asked yet. Models aren't forgiving. They read literally. Garbage in, confident garbage out.

Most RevOps data was designed for human consumption only. The fields made sense to whoever created them. The values are "close enough" for a manager reviewing pipeline. But LLMs and predictive models need precision, consistency, and completeness that human-readable data rarely provides.

The companies getting value from AI rebuilt their data layer with both audiences in mind. Everyone else is feeding well-dressed noise into expensive machinery.

## Meet People Where They Work

The second failure: AI that demands users change their habits.

RevOps teams design in a vacuum. They build automation requiring reps to log information in new places, follow new processes, check new dashboards. Each requirement seems reasonable. Together, they're asking people to abandon years of muscle memory.

The winning approach: integrate into existing tools—Slack, email, CRM sidebar—rather than create new destinations. Adapt to preferences rather than enforce one workflow. Some reps live in their inbox. Others never leave Salesforce. The AI layer should serve both.

AI that technically works can still practically fail if it requires opening a new tab. Sound technology, fatal human factors.

## Build for the AI You'll Have, Not the AI You Have

AI capabilities improve faster than most implementations can absorb. Systems designed for GPT-3.5 may fight against GPT-4's strengths.

Teams that struggle built point-to-point integrations. When the model changes, everything breaks.

Teams that adapt built abstraction layers. Swapping models is a configuration change, not a rewrite.

## The Test

Before starting: Can you produce a single, agreed-upon pipeline coverage number right now? If leadership would argue about the definition, your data layer isn't ready.

After launching: Where do people actually use it? Not where you hoped—where they actually do. If the answer is "nowhere consistently," the integration failed regardless of how good the AI is.

AI doesn't fail because the technology isn't ready. It fails because organizations skip the foundation work.
