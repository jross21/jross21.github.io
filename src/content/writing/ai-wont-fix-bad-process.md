title: "AI Won't Fix Your Bad Process"

The pitch is seductive: AI will automate your workflows, eliminate manual work, and scale your operations. What vendors don't mention is that AI automation amplifies whatever it touches—including your problems.

## The Amplification Effect

If your lead routing is broken, AI will route leads to the wrong reps faster.

If your data is messy, AI will propagate bad data more efficiently.

If your process has unnecessary steps, AI will automate unnecessary steps at scale.

Automation doesn't fix problems. It scales them.

## The Prerequisite

Before automating anything, you need a process that works manually. This sounds obvious, but most companies skip this step:

```
❌ "Our lead routing is slow, let's automate it"
✅ "Our lead routing works but takes too much time, let's automate it"
```

The difference is whether you're automating a working process or hoping automation will fix a broken one.

## What to Automate First

Start with processes that are:

1. **Well-defined** — Clear inputs, outputs, and decision criteria
2. **Repetitive** — Same steps, same logic, predictable outcomes
3. **Low-stakes** — Mistakes are easily caught and corrected
4. **Manual-first** — You've done it manually long enough to know the edge cases

Lead enrichment is a great first candidate. Lead routing can be, if your rules are solid. Complex approval workflows usually aren't—too many edge cases.

## The Right Order

1. Document the current process
2. Fix what's broken manually
3. Measure the manual process
4. Automate incrementally
5. Compare automated vs. manual metrics

If automated performance is worse, you've found a process problem—not a technology problem.

## The Meta-Point

AI is a capability multiplier. Multiply by zero, you still get zero. The companies getting value from AI automation are the ones who did the boring work first: clean data, clear processes, documented decisions.

The best time to fix your process was before you automated it. The second best time is now.
