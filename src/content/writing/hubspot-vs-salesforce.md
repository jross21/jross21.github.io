This isn't a feature comparison. You can find those anywhere. This is about when each platform actually makes sense.

## The Real Difference

HubSpot is designed to work out of the box. Salesforce is designed to be built.

That's not a value judgment—it's an architectural reality that should drive your decision.

## When HubSpot Wins

- **Team size under 50** — Less administration overhead
- **Product-led growth** — Native marketing automation is genuinely good
- **Moving fast** — Need a CRM running this week, not this quarter
- **Simple sales motion** — One product, straightforward pricing, clear ICP

HubSpot's constraints become features when you don't need flexibility. The platform makes decisions for you, which is valuable when you don't have bandwidth to make them yourself.

## When Salesforce Wins

- **Complex sales motions** — Multiple products, custom pricing, territory management
- **Enterprise deals** — Need CPQ, contract management, approval workflows
- **Compliance requirements** — Audit trails, field-level security, custom permissions
- **Integration ecosystem** — You need it to talk to 15 other systems reliably

Salesforce's complexity becomes a feature when your business is genuinely complex. The platform stays out of your way, which matters when you need to build something unique.

## The Wrong Question

"Which is better?" is the wrong question.

The right question: "What does our sales motion look like in 2 years, and which platform supports that?"

## Migration Considerations

Switching CRMs is expensive—not just in dollars, but in process disruption, retraining, and lost momentum. Get this decision right the first time. If you're unsure, err toward the platform that matches your complexity:

- Simpler than you think you need → HubSpot
- More complex than you want to admit → Salesforce

## One More Thing

Neither platform will fix bad process. If your pipeline stages don't make sense, changing CRMs won't help. Fix the process first, then pick the tool.
