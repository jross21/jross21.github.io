Tech debt isn't just a software engineering concept. Revenue operations accumulates its own version—and it's often invisible until something breaks.

## What RevOps Tech Debt Looks Like

- A Salesforce field that was "temporary" three years ago
- Five different lead sources that all mean "website" but are tracked separately
- That automation nobody understands but everyone's afraid to touch
- Reports that require manual adjustment before sharing with executives
- The spreadsheet that sits between two systems because nobody built the integration

Sound familiar?

## Why It Accumulates

RevOps teams are constantly under pressure to ship. There's always a new campaign, a new product, a new territory structure. "We'll fix it later" becomes the default—except later never comes.

The workarounds work. That's the problem. They work well enough that they stay, accumulating until your operations run on tribal knowledge and duct tape.

## The Compounding Effect

Each piece of tech debt makes the next change harder:

```
Year 1: Simple workaround, 5 minutes to explain
Year 2: Workaround has dependencies, 30 minutes to explain
Year 3: Multiple workarounds interact, requires documentation
Year 4: Nobody fully understands it, afraid to touch
```

## How to Address It

You can't fix everything at once. Instead:

1. **Audit quarterly** — Identify your top 3 most painful workarounds
2. **Allocate time** — Block 20% of capacity for debt reduction
3. **Document first** — Before fixing, write down how it works now
4. **Deprecate publicly** — Announce when old processes are ending

## The Real Cost

Tech debt isn't about elegance. It's about speed. Every workaround is a tax on future changes. When the business needs to pivot—new territory model, new product, new segment—tech debt is why it takes 6 weeks instead of 6 days.

The question isn't whether you can afford to address it. It's whether you can afford not to.
