        I spent years in enterprise GTM learning how AI and automation projects actually succeed or fail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Started in technical support at UMass, moved through sales engineering at a few companies, then enterprise GTM at DataRobot and Benchling. Selling AI to enterprises taught me what the gap between "this demo is impressive" and "the team actually uses it" looks like up close.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pattern was consistent: the technology worked, but adoption didn't. The problem was never the AI itself. It was everything around it—the workflows, the data foundations, the human processes that had to change for any of it to matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I stepped back to go deeper. Now I focus on the tooling layer that connects AI capabilities to business workflows: dbt for data transformation, Claude Code for agentic workflows, the infrastructure that makes AI actually useful in practice.
      </p>

      <p class="text-[var(--color-text)]">
        The gap I work in is the last mile—the part most vendors skip.
