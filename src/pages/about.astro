              Most RevOps people come from either strategy or engineering. I came through the sales floor, which means I've seen what breaks from every angle — the rep who can't trust the CRM data, the manager whose forecast is fiction, and the VP who can't explain why pipeline stalled.

            <p>
              I started as an SDR at Smartsheet, where I learned what bad data costs a rep — hours lost to wrong contacts, stale accounts, and routing logic that sent enterprise leads to the SMB queue. I developed prospecting sequences that got adopted team-wide, but the real education was watching how broken ops infrastructure makes good sellers worse.
            </p>

            <p>
              At DataRobot I moved into technical pre-sales for enterprise AI, then to CloudZero for cloud cost enablement, then to Benchling where I built the enterprise SDR function from scratch — developing qualification frameworks for $100K+ ACV deals and working closely with marketing ops on lead scoring and attribution.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each role showed me the same pattern: revenue teams don't fail because of strategy. They fail because the infrastructure underneath the strategy can't support it. So I decided to fix the infrastructure instead of complaining about it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since 2022, I've been building that infrastructure as an independent consultant — CRM architecture, data pipelines in Snowflake and dbt, AI-enabled lead qualification and routing, executive reporting layers. When LLMs arrived, I'd already been automating RevOps workflows for three years. The AI layer was a natural extension, not a pivot.

            <p>
              The question that keeps coming up in every engagement: why do smart revenue teams make decisions with data they don't trust? Usually it's because the data infrastructure was built for yesterday's org chart, the automation layer grew organically until nobody understood it, and the reporting reflects what's easy to measure rather than what matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think the best RevOps work is systems thinking applied to revenue — understanding how CRM architecture, data quality, automation logic, and reporting all connect, and building infrastructure that stays reliable as the team scales.
