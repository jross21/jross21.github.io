# Project: Julian's Consulting Website

## Tech Stack
- Astro static site
- Content in `src/content/writing/`

## Writing Content

**ALWAYS read `.claude/writer-skill.md` before generating or editing written content.**

This includes:
- New articles in `src/content/writing/`
- Revisions to existing articles
- Any marketing or consulting copy

### Article Format
- **Frontmatter:** title, description, category
- **Structure:** Setup → Problem → Insight → Application → Takeaway
- **Voice:** "Plainspoken, Highly Literate, Slightly Dangerous"

### Quick Reference
- Start with a claim, not a topic
- First 120 words must earn the read
- Headings every 150–250 words
- End with actionable takeaways
- No AI filler ("furthermore," "in today's fast-paced world," etc.)
